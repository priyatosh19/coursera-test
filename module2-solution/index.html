                <h2>The head</h2>
                <p>
                    The head is composed of the cranial and facial parts. It contains the brain, the centre
                    of the nervous system. The cranium is partly covered with hair. The parts of the face are the
                    forehead, the temples, the ears, the eyes with eyebrows, the cheeks, the nose, the jaw, the
                    mouth and the chin. The main parts of the mouth are lips, the tongue, the teeth, the palate and
                    the gums. The eyes are protected by eyelids and eyelashes. The eyes are the organs of sight.
                    The nose of smell, and the ears are the organs of hearing. The nerves of the skin are organs of
                    touch. The five senses are: sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.

                <p>
                    The head is attached to the trunk by the neck. The trunk includes the chest (in front),
                    the back, the shoulders and the abdomen. The internal organs which we cannot see, are the
                    heart, the lungs, the stomach, the liver with the gall-bladder, the pancreas, the spleen, the
                    kidneys and the small and large intestines (bowels).

                <p>
                    The arms and legs are called the limbs. The upper extremity (arm) consists of the upper
                    arm, the elbow, the forearm, the wrist and the hand with four fingers and one thumb. The
                    inner side of the hand is called the palm. The finger nails protect the finger tips.
